# Github Pages format for services

Add general description of service first, like what the service does, what part of the entire system it belongs to and how it is coneected to other services.

## Installation and setup

Dont't put a full instalation guide here, rather link to the installation guide in the readme. 
There should be information on everything that has to be installed in order for the service to fully function (e.g. DB-service should be installed for the price-service to work).

## Pictures

Screenshots of the service's frontend to show how the service looks like overall. 
Like this:

## Functionalities

Detailed description of every functionality here (every button, input field, ...). Add more screeenshots of detailed parts to illustrate which part of the service is explained.

### Functionality 1

### Fucntionality 2

## Additional Information

If there is any further information that should be included in the documentation of the service add it here.
